openlacrosse
============

This is an experimental C++ tool to read data from the Lacrosse WS-8610 weather stations, based on the existing open3600-based C-project, and a C#-port of that code, both to be found at the Yahoo groups. A cleaned-up version of the open3600-based tool is also to be found at my github: maleadt/open8610.

Note that this tool is _not_ ready-to-use (many bugs left, use open860 if you only care about reading your data). I have also stopped working on it, and I do not even own this weatherstation anymore. Feel free to fork the code though!
